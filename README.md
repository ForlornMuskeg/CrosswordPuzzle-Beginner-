# Crossword Puzzle Game

This program is a simple crossword puzzle game which asks the user some questions about my favourite games 
and display the answers on the board.

Have Fun :)

Note: This is my first code experience so I tried to keep it simple(non-object-oriented) but used as many c++ features as I could and explained them. I hope that this helps my beginner friends like me and gives them some ideas about what projects they can do.
